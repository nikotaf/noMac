# Contributing
First off all, thanks for taking the time and your interest to contribute!

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).<br>By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## Making code
There are many levels of code experience and knowledge out there.<br>The goal of this project is to provide an intentionally fully working code, and **not** the most intelligent one. If you believe, you have a secret desire to show off your skills, please do so but in a way the rest of the world can understand what you have done. After all, we all like to see, and mostly, understand, something we could never have realized.

## Submitting a pull request
1. [Fork](fork) and clone the repository
2. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b my-branch-name`
3. Make your change, add tests, and make sure the tests still pass
4. Push to your fork and [submit a pull request](pr)
5. Pat your self on the back and wait for your pull request to be reviewed and merged.

Here are a few things you can do that will increase the likelihood of your pull request being accepted:

* Write tests.
* Properly comment your code.
* Keep your changes as focused as possible. If there are multiple changes you would like to make that are not dependent upon each other, consider submitting them as separate pull requests.
* Write a good commit message.

Feel free to suggest any enhancement.
