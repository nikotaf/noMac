# noMac ![noMac](/noMAC.png?raw=true "noMAC icon")
Have you ever got any archive from other sources, bloated with folders containing those ._ system MACOS files? Or folders with image galeries, containing those thumbs.db files, which can be as much as some MBs?

Clean those reduntant, OS specific system files from your windows OS with noMAC.

Initialy designed for removing MACOS system files, but as I personaly don't index and don't use image previewing, I added the thumbs.db file too. After all, all I need is the actual content, not metadata nor thumbnails.

# Usage
Just drop files or folders in the noMAC.ahk file or its shortcut and it will clean them for you. Next, you can re-archive and be sure no reduntant files are saved.

# Warning
In case your system does use the thumbs.db file, it will be regenarated. But in MACOS, the dot files contain system info. Removing them from inside windows virtual system, may cause malfunction to the host.
